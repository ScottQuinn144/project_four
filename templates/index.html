        <p class="text-dark m-4">When founder Scott moved to Sweden, he began after a while to miss his hometown Ballarat in Australia.
          Very. He longed for barbecue smoke, spicy slow cooker and a place where people could gather to relax,
          laugh and enjoy really good Aussie barbecue.
          With the help of his family recipes, he opened his first restaurant in 2022 in GÃ¶teborg, which reminded him of everything he had left behind.
          For himself and anyone who wanted to feel at home.
          Today Scott can say that to cure his homesickness.
